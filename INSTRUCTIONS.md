# INSTRUCTIONS

1. **Implement the `get_forecast` Method**  
   - Add the `get_forecast` method to `script.py`.

2. **Ensure Code Style Compliance**  
   - Make the necessary changes to `script.py` so that it passes validation by `pycodestyle`.

3. **Update the Username in `script.py`**  
   - Replace the username `icaoberg` with your username in the following lines of `script.py`:

   ```python
   file.write('![Status](https://github.com/icaoberg/python-get-forecast/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)\n')
   file.write('![Status](https://github.com/icaoberg/python-get-forecast/actions/workflows/pretty.yml/badge.svg)\n')
   ```
   
in `script.py`.

4. **Verify Badge Status**
   - Once the above steps are complete and your code works, the two badges in README.md should display passing instead of failing. If you do the things above and your code words, then the two stickers in `README.md` should be labeled as `passing` instead of `failing`. 

5. **Submit Your Work**
   - If the badges indicate passing, submit your repository link on Canvas.
